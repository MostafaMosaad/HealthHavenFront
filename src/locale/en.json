  "storyContent": "We are a team of 5 scholars in the Information Technology Institute, and this website is our graduation project. Our aim is to address a common issue in our society - people losing their scan reports or doctor's descriptions, and having to wait in long lines to attain their prescribed medicines. To tackle this problem, we have created a personal health companion - a website that helps individuals keep track of their personal health, book appointments with doctors, and obtain approval for their scans and medicines from specific places to avoid long waiting times. Our goal is to make healthcare more accessible and convenient for everyone, and we are excited to bring this project to life.",
